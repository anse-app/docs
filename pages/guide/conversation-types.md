# Conversation Types

Currently, anse offers three conversation modes:

## Continuous Chat

This is an option similar to natural conversations, it remembers the history of the conversation.

Suitable for in-depth discussions on a particular topic.

## Single Chat

SingleChat is "one question, one answer". It does not record the context of the chat and clears the history after each new question is asked.

Suitable for temporary chat scenarios. After setting up System Info, SingleChat can also act as an assistant for solving specific scenarios (e.g. translation assistant).

## Image Generation

Image mode is currently used to text-to-image generations (image modification will be extended in the future). By entering a prompt, the AI will generate a picture that matches the input.
