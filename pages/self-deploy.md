# Overview

Anse is driven by [Astro](https://astro.build), so theoretically all deployment methods supported by Astro are supported by Anse.

If you want to save some complicated configuration, we recommend you use [Vercel](/self-deploy/vercel), [Netlify](/self-deploy/netlify) or [Docker](/self-deploy/docker) deployment. 

## Deploy on more servers
